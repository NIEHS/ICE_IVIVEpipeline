# Description

The workflow allows the flexibility to select from five different rat and human PK models: a one-compartment model that incorporates Monte Carlo simulation to simulate the population variance (1C), and four models leveraging the  [EPA's httk package](https://github.com/USEPA/CompTox-ExpoCast-httk) which include a 3 compartment model (solve_3comp), a multi-compartment PBPK model for modeling oral and i.v. exposure (solve_pbtk), a multi-compartment PBPK model for modeling inhalation (gas) route of exposure (solve_gas_pbtk), and a multi-compartment human PBPK model that includes both maternal and fetal compartments, and a placenta modeled as a joint organ shared by mother and fetus (solve_fetal_pbtk). The workflow is to predict the equivalent administered dose (EAD) that would lead to steady state plasma concentration or maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) equal to the bioactive concentration from in vitro assays. For inhalation exposures using the (solve_gas_pbtk) EAD is  generated in uM or ppmv if using"concentration" exposure vs a dose. 

Two example files are included:
* ChemicalData_Rnotebook.txt
* InvitroData_Rnotebookv.txt

# Load libraries

```{r}
#load libraries
library(tidyverse)   #needed for read-delim()
library(deSolve)
library(doParallel)
library(httk)        #this is needed for models: solve_3comp, solve_pbtk, solve_gas_pbtk, solve_fetal_pbtk
                     #The code is compatible with httk_2.2.2
library(xlsx)        #for writing the excel file that is user output 
date <- format(Sys.Date(), format="%y%m%d") #added to add information on date

```

# Input data and output file path
There are several input variables needed to run the code. Some variables are model specific, as detailed.
Adjust the file paths to point to the file in your directory.

chemFile: the file containing chemical data from ICE. this has the CASRN as the first field
assayFile: the file with the in vitro bioactivity data. The first column is the CASRN and the subsequent columns are the bioactivity values
output_file: this is the file for the outputs

```{r}
chemFile <- "ChemicalData_Rnotebook.txt" #chemicals data from ICE, include CASRN field as identifier
assayFile <- "InvitroData_Rnotebook.txt" #invitro data from ICE, includes CASRN field as identifier then acc/ac50
#chemFile <- "ChemicalData_VPA.txt"  
#assayFile <- "invitroData_VPA.txt"
Userout <- "User_Results.xlsx"           #file name (and path) for the output file for the tissue; concentrations with EAD estimations along with the in vitro data
EADplot_file <-"User_plot.pdf"           #the file for the plot of the EAD plot
invivo <- NULL                           #invivo data provided by user                   
#invivoFile <- "InvivoData_Rnotebook.txt"
#invivo <- as.data.frame(read_delim(invivoFile, delim = "\t"))    

```

# Model variables
Details about what model, route, and dose need to be specified. There are differences in what is needed if a 1 compartment model is used vs the PBPK models

# What model?
Models type is limited to 5 different models. Currently, species in ICE is limited to human or rat. Using this notebook one can expand the species with minor editing of the code provided the parameters are available. 

```{r}
species <- "human"                       #human or rat
bWeight <- 70                            #the body weight of simulated subject
modelType <-  "solve_fetal_pbtk"         #"1C", solve_3comp", "solve_pbtk", "solve_gas_pbtk", "solve_fetal_pbtk"; only 1C is capitalized.
```

For the 1 compartment model, values are needed to parameterize the Monte Carlo simulation. 

```{r}
nsamples <- 300                          #user-provided value for the mc simulations, any number between 10 - 10,000
```

For the PBPK models some additional parameters can be modified. An inhalation exposure has additional parameters
The route determines where the chemical will enter the system and route, interval, and days are needed for all PBPK models.

```{r}
route <- "oral"                          #oral, iv, or inhalation needed for PBPK models; "solve_gas_pbtk" uses the inhalation route 
interv <- 24                             #dosing interval, hours
ndays <- 3                               #number of days dosing is done
expDose <- 1                             #current calculations assume 1mg/kg/dose for "1C", "solve_3comp", "solve_pbtk", "solve_fetal_pbtk".   
expConc <- 1                             #Dosing for "solve_gas_pbtk" model
ConcentrationUnit <- "uM"                #Renamed as Output Conc. Units in PBPK tool since ICE4.0. Options are uM and mg/L, but this is not available option for the ICE UI since the unit for in vitro activity concentration provided in ICE is uM; The user need to make sure                                                 
                                         #the unit for in vitro activity concentration is consistent with the "ConcentrationUnit" they select.
gestationDays <- 91                      #gestational days when dose starts, range is 91 days (14 weeks) -  280 days (40 weeks)

```

# Inhalation specific parameters
For an inhalation route of exposure, there are 2 different ways that the exposure can be modeled. "expDose" models a set bolus dose like the exposure for an oral or IV exposure. The "expConc" is more typical of a gas exposure. This models an inhaled concentration over a duration of time, set by "expLength".  The "expDose" option is currently unavailable.

```{r}
gasDosing <-"expConc"                    #two dosing option methods for solve_gas_pbtk model, "expConc" and "expDose", 
                                         #but for ICE3.3 release, "expConc" is the only option due to a bug found in httk function
                                         #This is only needed if gasDosing =="expConc" because otherwise default to expDose
if(gasDosing =="expConc" & (!exists("expConc") || is.null(expConc))){
  expConc <- 1                           #current calculations assume 1uM of air concentration
}
gasInputUnit <- "ppmv"                   #Input concentration unit for gas model (httkv2.1.0 and later), "uM" or "ppmv" (default)
expLength <- .25                         #length of the gas exposure, hours
```

# Gestation model specific parameters

```{r}
gestationDays <- 91                #gestation model specific parameter;gestational days when dose starts, range is 91 days (14 weeks) -  280 days (40 weeks)
```

```{r}
chemDisplay <- "ChemicalName"            #choice is "CASRN" or "ChemicalName"
if(modelType != "solve_gas_pbtk"){       #"mg/kg/dose" for "1C", "solve_3comp", "solve_pbtk"; uM or ppmv for "solve_gas_pbpk" model
  EADUnit <- "mg/kg/dose"
}else{EADUnit <- gasInputUnit}

# Load functions

```{r}
                                         #All required R scripts and input files should be in the working directory
source("steadyState.R")                  #required for "1C" model

```

# Load data
Notice that the chem input has the source of the FU and Clint data. ICE now has 2 different sources of these values so the source is important for tracking this information.

```{r}
#there are single quotes in chemical names that need to be addressed, the tidyR handles well
chemical <- as.data.frame(read_delim(chemFile, delim = "\t"))

```

# Preparing data
Minor prep work is done on the data that comes from ICE 
Partitioning coefficients are obtained by internal function from the httk package using the provided phys chem parameters. Compare with the example input file for naming
Note that a few checks are done. These will generate flags that can be used to follow up as needed.

# 1C modeling
If modelType given by the user is "1C"
This will run a simple, 1 compartment model. In this model the C steady state is determined vs the C max from the other models.

# Calculating the EADs
The 1C model has a monte carlo simulation that calculates the Css at the 50th and the 95th percentile
The first step is generating the CSS object with the call to "steadState". 

```{r}

# script to run pbpk models from httk package
This code is used if modelType given by the user is a PBPK model: "solve_3comp", "solve_pbtk", "solve_gas_pbpk", or "solve_fetal_pbtk.
This is wrapper code to format the inputs and parameters needed to run the models specified by the httk package.
In addition, the output is formatted so that it matches the 1C model. This allows easy comparison between the different files for subsequent processing.

## Parameter processing for the pbpk models
The httk package needs some additional parameters including the correct capitalization of the species and ensuring that the adding of the user-specified data to the chem table is properly integrated.

# solve_gas_pbtk model
The [solve_gas_pbtk](https://rdrr.io/cran/httk/man/solve_gas_pbtk.html) is a PBPK model similar to the "solve_pbtk" model but is uses an inhalation route of exposure assuming the chemical is volatile (gas). As a result, it has some addtional checks to see if the assumption of gas exposure is reasonable but will still proceed with a flag warning. It also includes 2 different dosing approaches, a concentration over time (expConc) or a single dose (expDose)

# solve_fetal_pbtk model
The [solve_fetal_pbtk](https://rdrr.io/cran/httk/man/solve_fetal_pbtk.html) is a human PBPK model that includes both maternal and fetal compartments and a placenta modeled as a joint organ shared by mother and fetus.
